The BoonOrg.Identification.Interfaces package provides the API to identify class instances by name and GUID.
The class Identity which derives from IIdentity can be used as the base class for any thing you to find again after storing it in a container.
Identity is part of the BoonOrg.Identification.Domain package.
The BoonOrg.Identification.Addin package registers (a subset of) the identity APIs.
